This is a simple module that produces random characters of a specified limit
and then it will place them into a data collection of your choice. I made 
this to automate having to make these lists and dictionaries over and over
again for challenges like on HackerRank and CodeWars. There will be further
revisions in the future that will expand on the core functionality of 
the random character generator such as a username/password generator and 
also ability to save output to documents. For now, just run in a terminal
and copy and paste into your ide.
